# **👋 Welcome to My Cloud Engineering Journey!**

### 🚀 About Me
Hi there! My name is Mykhaylo, and I'm transitioning into **Cloud Engineering**.

After seven years working on cruise ships across 52 countries and experiencing various industries, I discovered my passion for technology. I taught myself Python, built a machine learning system for predictive analytics, and now I'm diving deep into cloud infrastructure with AWS.

**☁️ Why Cloud Engineering?**

Cloud technology is transforming every industry. I'm fascinated by building scalable, reliable infrastructure that powers modern applications. My background in fast-paced, problem-solving environments translates well to designing and managing cloud systems.
