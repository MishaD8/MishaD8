# 👋 Welcome to My Cloud Security Journey!

### 🚀 About Me
Hi there! My name is Mykhaylo, and I’m currently transitioning from the world of transportation & logistics into **Cloud Security**.

🔐 Why Cloud Security?  
Working in transport and logistics, I saw firsthand how important **security** is for critical supply chains. Now I’m combining that real-world experience with technical skills — to protect cloud environments from modern threats.
